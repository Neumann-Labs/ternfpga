## 2026-06-08 — Genesis & the pivot

**Origin.** Started as a "what could a $130 Xilinx Arty A7 do that's genuinely impressive?" exploration. First framing chased determinism / cycle-exact matmul / a security-attestation angle. Killed it — matmul is elementary, NN training *wants* stochasticity so bit-exact determinism is a niche concern, and the security angle wasn't the point.

**The pivot.** Reframed to: *solve a real ML-systems problem the industry actually cares about, using the cheap FPGA, benchmarked against a real GPU.* Ran an 8-angle problem-space survey (32 opportunities, 119 verified sources). The signal that showed up loudest, repeatedly: **ternary (BitNet b1.58) LLM inference** and **activation sparsity** — two things a GPU structurally cannot exploit in silicon.

**Key realization — be honest about the hardware.** The Arty A7-35T has ~280× less memory bandwidth than an RTX 3060. It will **lose raw throughput**, full stop. The credible wins are **energy-per-token**, **batch-1 latency**, and **capability** (native ternary, per-token unstructured sparsity). Any claim of "40× faster" would be dishonest; the defensible claim is **4–8× better energy/token (ternary) / 10–20× (+sparsity) on identical numerics**, measured board-to-board.

**The program (A/B/D).** One hand-built ternary PE (`acc += (w=+1?a:w=−1?−a:0)`, a 6-LUT, zero DSP) wrapped three ways:
- **A** — ternary energy/token engine (DDR3-streamed ~300M model; the 2B doesn't fit 256 MB).
- **D** — skip 85–95% activation sparsity that the GPU computes anyway → cut DDR3 traffic, the actual bottleneck.
- **B** — reuse it as the 3060's speculative-decode draft engine (async drafting to hide the 100 Mb-Eth round-trip).

**Hardware confirmed.** Board is an Arty A7-**35T** (`xc7a35t`, IDCODE `0x0362d093`), flashable via openFPGALoader. worker4 toolchain installed: Vivado 2025.2 (verified), verilator 5.020, cocotb 2.0, openFPGALoader 0.12. Project lives on a dedicated 400 GB LV at `/srv/fpga` (off the prod `/srv/eval-results`). worker4 also has an **RTX 3060 12 GB** (currently on `nouveau`; NVIDIA card is the *primary* boot GPU and owns the console framebuffer → the CUDA-driver install will want a reboot in a maintenance window — deferred until the Phase-1 benchmark, since Phase 0 needs no GPU).

**Repo created.** `Neumann-Labs/ternfpga`, Apache-2.0. Practices: TDD (cocotb test before RTL), benchmark-early, Conventional Commits, this build log. Authoring on the Mac; build/sim/flash on worker4.

**Next:** Phase 0 — hand-write the ternary PE, prove it bit-exact vs a NumPy golden in cocotb, simulate the sparsity bytes-saved curve, stand up the `bitnet.cpp` CPU baseline, and pick/distill the ~300M relu-fied ternary model.
